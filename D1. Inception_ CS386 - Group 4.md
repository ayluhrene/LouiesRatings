**Introduction**: Describe in one paragraph what your project is about. Make clear what problem your software is solving and the context of the solution.

It’s always unclear how to feel walking into a new semester. The changing environment and different expectations prove to be very demanding during this period of adjustment. The web application “Louie’s Ratings” is designed to make this very period of fluctuation that many students at NAU go through semesterly an experience that features far more confidence. Our website features direct access to all the information a student may need about their changing classes and professors, including detailed grade distributions from previous semesters, direct insight from previous students on specific roadblocks in the curriculum, detailed breakdowns on different graded class elements and their contribution to a students overall grade, and finally information on a professor and their specific style to inform a students choices on a class or how a student may approach a class. Depending on specific constraints like legality, this site may also feature past syllabus access for students interested in a class and its expectations or possibly a direct comparison system between professors.

**Initial value proposition and customer segments**: report the initial guesses for the (i) value proposition and (ii) customer segment. The value proposition is different from the feature(s) your software will offer. See examples on the lecture slides.

Louie’s Ratings will provide NAU students with quick, easy access to everything they want to know about their courses and professors in order to maximize their confidence going into each semester. Louie’s Ratings makes finding the information they need before committing to courses convenient to find and access.

Interviewer: Jeffrey Hoelzel  
Interviewee: Cale Hines  
When: 9/19/2024  
Customer segment: Students

Key insights:  
\*In his particular case, he is not very fond of Rate My Professor because he feels that because there are so few options for professors teaching higher level engineering courses, he feels there is no reason to check for ratings.   
\*He would like to see a tool implemented in the manage-classes section of Louie that would function similarly to Rate My Professor, but is more interested in seeing a graphical representation of grade distributions for each course.

Representative quotes:   
“Never have really felt it necessary to speak with an advisor, the engineering progression plan works just fine.”  
“Never found it worth checking Rate My Professor because of lack of options when you get to higher level engineering course. There might be like one or two professors teaching a required course.”  
“I usually use Jack’s Planner, that helps a lot. Not a big fan of Rate My Professor.”  
“I would absolutely be interested in seeing the grades per section in a graphical format, I want to know how hard a course is going to be, so I would also like to know how many people withdraw.”

Assessment:   
\*Grade Distribution \- Must have  
\*Comments/Insights System \- Nice to have  
\*Simple & Effective Graphing System \- Must have

Interviewer: Jeffrey Hoelzel  
Interviewee: Jacy Wilson  
When: 9/19/2024  
Customer segment: Students

Key insights:  
\*Uses Rate My Professor and the grade distribution website, looks like a giant spreadsheet because she is very interested in how many students withdraw from particular courses, more so then seeing how many students pass or fail.  
\*She likes the idea of Rate My Professor, but as she gets into higher level courses, she finds that people who complain about a professor and get a bad grade are not very reliable; she wants to hear from students who did well in a course but actually got the grade they want.  
\*Would be very interested to see some sort of projected drop rates for a particular course.

Representative quotes:   
“Early on, I used Rate My Professor to pick my classes every semester. But as I get into my major specific and higher level courses, I find that most people who do poorly in a class and complain on Rate My Professor about it, are not the most reliable source. I want to hear from students who did well in a course but hated the professor, that to me is more valuable.”  
“I feel that Louie does a decent job of listing out everything you need to know about a course, but could use a rating system for professors built in.”  
“I would love to see how many A’s, C’s, and W’s there are for a course and also who taught that section.”  
“I would be very interested in seeing the projected dropout rate for students for a course, like ‘how many students dropped biochem last semester with this professor or that professor?’.”

Assessment:   
\*Grade Distribution \- Must have  
\*Comments/Insights System \- Must have  
\*Simple & Effective Graphing System \- Must have  
\*Rates of how many students dropped a course/failed \- Must have

Interviewer: John-Patrick Leis  
Interviewee: Lincoln Lake   
When: 9/19/2024  
Customer segment: Students

Key insights:  
\*Average class grade/level of difficulty is a big factor in this interviewee’s ideal class choice.  
\*This interviewee referenced a comments/insight section and I believe this to be a very good idea  
\*Mentioned side by side comparisons, which does not seem inherently difficult and would help speed up the process

Representative quotes:   
“Last year was rough and it felt like I got the toughest professor for every subject”  
“Being able to see grade distributions ahead of time and what potential professors would help me prepare better for a coming year, instead of being stuck with To Be Announced under the professor’s name and stuck guessing”  
“RateMyProfessor is great, but there is a lot of information to filter and it does not have results for some professors so I’ve been left to go in blind many times”  
“Side-by-side comparison would be a very nice feature to help narrow down choices”  
“Course specific reviews would be nice to see how an overall department feels about a prospective course”  
“Having a simple site that is catered to NAU would be insane. Having a grade distribution and graphs to represent it, along with other necessary information for each teacher, would increase my level of confidence for a semester”

Assessment:   
\*Grade Distribution \- Essential  
\*Comments/Insights System \- Must have  
\*Simple & Effective Graphing System \- Must have

Interviewer: John-Patrick Leis  
Interviewee: Alexander Hubbard  
When: 09/18/2024  
Customer Segment: Student

Key Insights:   
\* This interviewee brought up how important it is to be able to access a previous years syllabus/course calendar  
\* This interviewee responded very well to the idea of a comments/insights section  
\*This interviewee also referenced a tag system for our site for professors and also color coding based on grade distributions like red, yellow, and green in favor of any real graphs

Representative quotes:  
“Last year was tough, almost every class had no professor listed so there wasn’t anything for me to look at to gauge what I was walking into”  
“Rate my professor is probably my main utility for choosing classes, but there is some data it doesn’t show and some data that cannot be shown by numbers”  
“Knowing a professors expectations and having access to their potential syllabus is huge to know about extra credit, opportunities to skip the final, and class grading sections and how much of your overall grade they account for”  
“Simplicity is nice, I don’t like having to do too many searches and too much looking around to get what I’d like to see”

Assessment:   
\*Grade Distribution \- Essential  
\*Comment/Insight System \- Must have  
\*Tags/Color Coding \- Must have

Interviewer: Ayla Tudor  
Interviewee: Clarity Plume  
When: 9/18/2024  
Customer segment: Students

Key insights:  
\*Having access to the course syllabus ahead of time is really useful in determining whether they want to take a course.  
\*Likes to be able to quickly assess a professor and course, spending as little time as possible on researching them.  
\*Also likes to have as much information about a course and professor available to them as possible in order to feel confident going into the semester  
\*Acknowledges that graphs and grade distributions could be useful for others, but isn’t necessarily interested in them for themself

Representative quotes:   
“I look at the professors to see if I know them and if it’s going to be an enjoyable course to take or if there’s somebody else I’d prefer to take the course from”  
“I like when professors give you their syllabus ahead of time. A couple have and it’s really helpful because it just helps me plan things ahead of time and get to know a little bit about the course before”

Assessment:   
\*Nice to have, but interviewee feels that NAU resources and rateMyProfessor have enough information for them personally  
\*Believes that the features present in rateMyProfessor are must haves and think they should be included in our product as well (tags, color-coding, comments, etc.)  
\*Likes to have data and reviews to look at as a supplemental resource, but cares more about being able to gauge a course/professor as quickly and easily as possible.

Interviewer: Luke Bowen  
Interviewee: Faith  
When: 9/17/2024  
Consumer Segment: NAU Students

Key Insights:  
\*Rate My Professor is nice to have, but it is subjective and based on what each person experienced with that professor and chose to submit to the website.  
\*Interviewee wants to know professors teaching style before first day of class (grade weights, lecture heavy or interactive classes)

Representative Quotes:  
“RateMyProfessor is thorough enough and not really missing anything, but I don’t always trust it since it is subjective”  
“If there was a way to know each professor’s style of teaching ahead of time that would probably change how I choose which classes to enroll in.”

Assessment:  
\*Knowing class flow \- Nice to have  
\*Objective data on professors (grade distribution) \- Must Have

\*Knowing class flow ahead of time would be very helpful  
\*Being able to visualize the data would be very helpful

Representative Quotes:

4. **Final value proposition and customer segments**: Report the refined versions of these elements (the ones you refined based on the interviews). The customer segment(s) should be narrow, and there must be enough representation of the segment(s) in the interviews. 

The software should be convenient, visually appealing, and helpful for the users. The customers are NAU students who register for their own classes and would like more information.
