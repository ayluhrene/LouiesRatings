## Introduction
It’s always unclear how to feel walking into a new semester. The changing environment and different expectations prove to be very demanding during this period of adjustment. The web application “Louie’s Ratings” is designed to make this very period of fluctuation that many students at NAU go through semesterly an experience that features far more confidence. Our website features direct access to all the information a student may need about their changing classes and professors, including detailed grade distributions from previous semesters, direct insight from previous students on specific roadblocks in the curriculum, detailed breakdowns on different graded class elements and their contribution to a student's overall grade, and finally information on a professor and their specific style to inform a student's choices on a class or how a student may approach a class. Depending on specific constraints like legality, this site may also feature past syllabus access for students interested in a class and its expectations or possibly a direct comparison system between professors.

## Initial Value Proposition and Customer Segments
Louie’s Ratings will provide NAU students with quick, easy access to everything they want to know about their courses and professors in order to maximize their confidence going into each semester. Louie’s Ratings makes finding the information they need before committing to courses convenient to find and access.
