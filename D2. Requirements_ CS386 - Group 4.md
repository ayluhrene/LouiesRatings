### **1\. Positioning**

*1.1 Problem statement*

The problem of information for future NAU class scheduling being difficult to find affects NAU Computer Science students; the impact of which is students walking into new school semesters unprepared and uninformed, leading to lower grades and enhanced stress.

*1.2 Product Position Statement*

For NAU Computer Science students who are looking to enhance their semesterly scheduling experience, Louie’s Ratings is a comprehensive data tool that allows CS students to not only view and examine professor reviews from previous semesters, but also the previous grade distributions in a graphical format; unlike RateMyProfessor, our product will offer more detailed information specialized to NAU classes and feature past grade distributions. 

*1.3 Value proposition and customer segment*

**Value proposition:** Louie’s Ratings is a website that allows NAU CS Students to feel more secure and informed about their enrollment decisions based off more accurate and readily available resources regarding the class and professor. 

**Consumer segment:** NAU CS students planning to enroll in courses for their next semester.

### **2\. Stakeholders**

- NAU faculty  
- CS Professors  
- Incoming CS students  
- Returning CS students  
- RateMyProfessor  
- Developers (us)

### **3\. Functional requirements (features)**

- User login system   
- Search bar for class pages
- Search bar for professor pages
- Displays comments, ratings, and grade distribution visualization on information pages
- Allows for users to enter ratings and comments
- Comments can be removed by administrators

### **4\. Non-functional requirements**

- For insights and comments, a comment should be able to be up to 255 characters or less in order to limit the size of information being stored and displayed
- Display scalability for different screen sizes to allow for website to be usable on multiple devices
- Page framework is reused so that information is scalable
- User authentication passwords should be RSA encoded for security
- Limit users to one comment/insight per class section to prevent comments spamming

### **5\. MVP**

The minimal viable product based on our project inception will be a simple website with a homepage, grade distribution data specifically for CS professors, and an insight/comment section for our grade distribution data. The essential functionalities of our website will be tested by us, the developers, and a small sample of NAU students for feedback. We will be validating proper working order for the website and its basic functionalities (displaying grade distributions, searching for professors, and user comments).
