---

### **1\. Positioning**

*1.1 Problem statement*

The problem of information for future NAU class scheduling being difficult to find affects NAU Computer Science students; the impact of which is students walking into new school semesters unprepared and uninformed, leading to lower grades and enhanced stress.

*1.2 Product Position Statement*

For NAU Computer Science students who are looking to enhance their semesterly scheduling experience, Louie’s Ratings is a comprehensive data tool that allows CS students to not only view and examine professor reviews from previous semesters, but also the previous grade distributions in a graphical format; unlike RateMyProfessor, our product will offer more detailed information specialized to NAU classes and feature past grade distributions. 

*1.3 Value proposition and customer segment*

**Value proposition:** Louie’s Ratings is a website that allows NAU CS Students to feel more secure and informed about their enrollment decisions based off more accurate and readily available resources regarding the class and professor. 

**Consumer segment:** NAU CS students planning to enroll in courses for their next semester.

### **2\. Stakeholders**

- NAU faculty - Potential sponsers of Louie's Ratings, these stakeholders have a keen interest in ensuring the platform is fair and constructive instead of hurtful as Louie's Ratings may hurt the professional reputations of those they oversee.
- CS Professors - Computer science professors are an important stakeholder as they are those being directly rated and evaluated empirically by students. As such, these ratings may personally affect their reputations with students and even their overall job success. In contrast, this tool may be a valuable teacher for informing a professor of their weaknesses or strengths that may allow a professor to grow.  
- Incoming CS students - Incoming students are important stakeholders as they may use this software to make informed descisions on course selections for a whole semester period. This allows them to prepare for a semester that aligns with their own accademic goals and thus the software must be not only useful but accurate.  
- Returning CS students - Returning students may both utilize and contribute to Louie's Ratings as stakeholders. These students shape the website itself through their reviews they kindly put out to inform others. In turn, they utilitze other returning students reviews to select and/or prepare for their upper division classes.  
- RateMyProfessor - Albeit indirect, RateMyProfessor is an important stakeholder as it defines the unique features that give Louie's Ratings its value through competition. This competition is essential to making Louie's Ratings stand out on the market through its locally visualized theme. 
- Developers (us) - As the developers of Louie's Ratings, we are essential to not only building, but also maintaining the software and ensuring value to our users. We desire Louie's Ratings to be the user friendly platform that we envision, while also aligning with our needs as students and beneficiaries. 

### **3\. Functional requirements (features)**

1. Allows for users to enter ratings and comments - 5/5 priority
2. Displays comments, ratings, and grade distribution visualization on information pages 5/5
3. Search bar for professor pages - 4/5
4. Search bar for class pages - 4/5
5. User login system - 3/5  
6. Comments can be removed by administrators - 2/5

### **4\. Non-functional requirements**

1. Display scalability for different screen sizes to allow for website to be usable on multiple devices - 5/5 priority
2. Page framework is reused so that information is scalable - 5/5
3. For insights and comments, a comment should be able to be up to 255 characters or less in order to limit the size of information being stored and displayed 3/5
4. User authentication passwords should be RSA encoded for security 2/5
5. Limit users to one comment/insight per class section to prevent comments spamming 1/5

### **5\. MVP**

The minimal viable product based on our project inception will be a simple website with a homepage, grade distribution data specifically for CS professors, and an insight/comment section for our grade distribution data. The essential functionalities of our website will be tested by us, the developers, and a small sample of NAU students for feedback. We will be validating proper working order for the website and its basic functionalities (displaying grade distributions, searching for professors, and user comments).
