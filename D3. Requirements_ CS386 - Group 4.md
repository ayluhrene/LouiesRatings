## **D.3 Analysis**

#### **1. System Description**

For NAU Computer Science students who are looking to enhance their semesterly scheduling experience, Louie’s Ratings is a comprehensive data tool that allows CS students to not only view and examine professor reviews from previous semesters but also the previous grade distributions in a graphical format. Unlike RateMyProfessor, our product will offer more detailed information specialized to NAU classes and feature past grade distributions. 

NAU class scheduling overall has been a big issue for NAU Computer Science students. This issue makes students walk into new semesters unprepared and uninformed, leading to lower grades and enhanced stress. Louie’s Ratings is a website that allows NAU CS students to feel more secure and informed about their enrollment decisions based on more accurate and readily available resources regarding classes and professors.

Louie’s Ratings **users** will be able to access the application through a website. By using the **searchbar**, they will have direct **access** to Computer Science **professor** and **class** grade distributions with **graph** visualizations upon entry. This data is centered around the *grade distributions* for pages surrounding specific classes and pages surrounding specific professors as well. Depending on the user's interest, they may **search** through the **rating** database for data related to their future class interests.

Additionally, a **user** will be able to **create** or **log in** to an account by creating a **username** and **password**. The linked *email* must be a verified **NAU email**. An account will be tagged with their **major***.

Logging in grants a **user** enhanced capabilities on the website itself, including access to the **commenting**, *tagging*, and **rating** system. This allows a **user** to leave valuable data for incoming users looking to enhance their semesterly planning or review feedback.

As a standout feature, the website will include an **insight board**, which will contain useful tips for incoming students. Here, users may **ask questions**, for insight on class dynamics or **leave useful feedback** about a class for others. This dashboard feature will be accessible to users who are not logged in, but they will still be able to *observe* comments on the insight board.
