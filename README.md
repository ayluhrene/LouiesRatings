### Why Louie's Ratings
Rather than using multiple websites to get class information, our idea is to consolidate these into one user-friendly site.
### What Our Product Is
Louie's Ratings is an NAU class information aggregator website. A web based tool similar to Rate My Professor that also shows data in a graphical format of the amount of students who received A’s, B’s, failed, withdrawn, etc. from previous semesters reported directly from professors. It also displays anonymous data collected from the end of semester course evaluations under each professor. Shows information on what each course is about, if students (dis)like a course, how difficult it is, etc.
